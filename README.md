======

Utopia is a very light weight PHP framework specifically designed for Service Oriented Architecture.

Version 1 of Utopia is very light weight, and designed for an all-in-1 PHP framework that is easy to set up and use.

I used it on many projects, but sadly have not kept it maintained in the last few years as I left PHP for a while.

While I was away, I have designed this new way of building and depploying SOA architectures. This architecture is actiually Language agnostic, so I will be creating several language versions of Utopia
